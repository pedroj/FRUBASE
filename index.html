<p>Plant names and names of higher taxonomic categories have been checked with:
Mabberley, D.J. 1987. The plant-book. A portable dictionary of the higher plants. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.</p>

<p>Please, contact me if you have suggestions, find errors, inconsistencies, orany other bug in the file. As well, please let me know about your uses of this data and send manuscripts and reprints when available. I´ll be happy to help you in any case, as far as I can.</p>

<p>I am periodically updating this data base since I started writing my PhD thesis more than 10 years ago. Thus, I´d like to receive suggestions for new data sources and provide updated versions to those interested.</p>

<p>Please, use these data files for peaceful purposes, enjoy doing science with them as I have enjoyed writing the paper quoted above, and learn as much as you can with them. They are the result of splendid work by many people working with plant-frugivore interactions and are embedded in papers reporting very interesting results, descriptions and discussions on these interactions; please read them.</p>

<h3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>

<p>This data base is the result of many hours of work compiling names and numbers from a very sparse literature. I've benefited from the help of Myriam Márquez, who aided carefully with data checking several times. Carlos M. Herrera helped with unpublished data and by providing literature sources; his advice and comments were always invaluable. F.H.J. Crome also provided his original data just at the start of this project. Comments and advice from Paulo R. Guimarães Jr., Mauro Galetti, H. Martin Schaefer and Alfredo Valido were very helpful for the 2008 version. Computer time and facilities were kindly provided by the Centro de Informatica Cientifica de Andalucia. Financial support was from the Spanish Direccion General de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica, projects PB-87-0452 and PB-91-0114.</p>
