                              Working on new version 5.0. Feb 2015!!

THE FRUBASE PACKAGE ACCOMPANIES:

Jordano, P. 1995. Angiosperm fleshy fruits and seed dispersers: a comparative
analysis of adaptation and constraints in plant-animal interactions. American
Naturalist 145: 163-191.

It contains a copy of the main data file exactly as used for this paper, as 
well as other accompanying files (see below).

Taxonomic arrangement follows: 
Cronquist, A. (1981). An integrated system of classification of flowering 
plants. Columbia University Press.

Nomenclature follows Stevens, P. F. (2001 onwards). Angiosperm Phylogeny 
Website. Version 8, June 2007. http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/. 
This scheme follows: A.P.G. [= Angiosperm Phylogeny Group] II. 2003. An update 
of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families 
of flowering plants: APG II. Bot. J. Linnean Soc. 141: 399-436.

Plant names and names of higher taxonomic categories have been checked with:
Mabberley, D.J. 1987. The plant-book. A portable dictionary of the higher
plants. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.

Please, contact me if you have suggestions, find errors, inconsistencies, or
any other bug in the file. As well, please let me know about your uses of this
data and send manuscripts and reprints when available. I'll be happy to help
you in any case, as far as I can.

I am periodically updating this data base since I started writing my PhD 
thesis more than 20 years ago. Thus, I'd like to receive suggestions for new
data sources and provide updated versions to those interested.

Please, use these data files for peaceful purposes, enjoy doing science with
them as I have enjoyed writing the paper quoted above, and learn as much as
you can with them. They are the result of splendid work by many people working
with plant-frugivore interactions and are embedded in papers reporting very
interesting results, descriptions and discussions on these interactions; 
please read them.

********************************** CONTENTS ***********************************
All files are plain ASCII text files, with the exception of SUMMARY and 
FRUBASE.xls.
Those with data have TABs as their field delimiters so they can be readily
imported in any statistical package or spreadsheet program. The FRUBASE.txt is
readily imported by any spreadsheet application. Please, contact me if you need
the files formatted in other ways (e.g., my original SAS datasets, or EXCEL
worksheets). 

1. README.txt - This file. Including a description of the variables and a 
   listing of the literature sources with the numeric codes.
2. Summary.doc - A summary file (originally intended to appear as an Appendix 
   in my 1995 paper) summarizing mean values for the main families and genera 
   in the data base. This is a Microsoft WORD (version 6.0) file, which can be
   read directly either by the Mac or Windows versions of the program.
3. REFS.txt - A long list with the source reference used for each species in 
   the data file. The file is TAB delimited and has a header line with variable 
   names: FAMILY, GENUS, SPECIES, NEWREF, and REFERENCE (authors and year).
4. FRUBASE.txt - The data file itself. Missing data are indicated by dots (.). 
   The file is TAB delimited and has a header line with variable names as in
   the list below. The file is sorted by FAMILY, GENUS, and SPECIES names, in 
   ascending order.
5. FRUBASE.xls - The data file itself, now in Excel format for spraedsheets. 
   See (4).

***************************** ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ********************************
This data base is the result of many hours of work compiling names and numbers 
from a very sparse literature. I've benefited from the help of Myriam Marquez,
Alicia Prieto and Rocio Requerey, who aided carefully with data checking 
several times. Carlos M. Herrera helped with unpublished data and by providing 
literature sources. F.H.J. Crome also provided his original data just at the 
start of this project. 
Computer time and facilities were kindly provided by the Centro de Informatica 
Cientifica de Andalucia. Financial support was from the Spanish Direccion 
General de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica, projects PB-87-0452 and 
PB-91-0114.
********************************** HISTORY ************************************
version 1.- 16 April 1983. Only 219 species.
version 1.5 - 23 December 1991. Added many species with information on fruit
              size only and completed the literature survey up to 1991.
version 1.9 - 4 May 1994. Prepared the first version of this package. Recoding
              of the reference numbers to accomodate the inclusion of the
              appendix.
version 2.0 - 12 January 1995. Added the SUMMARY file and minor changes to this
              file.
version 3.0 - A major update to the dataset, adding new variables such as fruit
              color, growth habit, etc. Major addition of species. Started 
              revision 12 Feb 2003.
version 4.0 - A major update to the dataset, with revision of the taxonomic
              arrangement according to: Stevens, P. F. (2001 onwards). 
              Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. Version 8, June 2007. 
              http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/. This scheme follows:

              399-436.
              Revision completed 25 November 2007.
version 5.0 - Working on a new updated dataset based on the Git repository.
              Thorough checking the species names and taxonomy with R package
              taxize. Adding new species to dataset from updated sources.
              WORKING ON IT!!!
